### Google Search
- A module that searches google (This is my first time making a sucessful module)
### how to install?
- Since this is very simple i will not put it on Pypi so you can install like this:
```bash
python3 -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/Sengolda/googlesearch
```
- Other way (Not recomended):
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Sengolda/googlesearch.git
$ cd downloads/googlesearch-main
$ python3 -m pip install -U .
```
- Make sure you replace "Downloads" with where your one has been saved
